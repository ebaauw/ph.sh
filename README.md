### Notice
This repository has been deprecated.  NodeJS versions of `ph.sh` and `json.sh` are included in [homebridge-hue](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-hue).  They can also be installed separately from [homebridge-hue-utils](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-hue-utils).

This repository now only contains the `ph_rules.sh` and `ph_sensors.sh` scripts, which have not yet been converted to NodeJS.
